Palindrome Rap Identifier Tool

I've always been into rap music â€” especially Indian Hip Hop and Desi Hip Hop. The flow, the rhyme, the lyricism â€” it's an art form I genuinely admire.

While exploring different writing styles, I came across something surprisingly complex and niche â€” **Palindrome Rap**.

It's a form where lines are crafted to read the same forward and backward â€” either by:

- **Letters**: where each character mirrors exactly  
- **Words**: where the sentence structure flips perfectly

Think of it as **lyrical symmetry** â€” tough to pull off, and even tougher to make it sound smooth.

I didnâ€™t discover it from an article or a blog. I found it through a track by **Goush**, a seriously talented rap artist.  
His music sparked a curiosity in me, and I ended up diving deep into palindrome bars.

So I built something fun â€” a **Palindrome Rap Identifier**.  
Paste your lyrics into it and it'll tell you if your bars are palindromes by:

- Letters  
- Words  
- Or both

### Here are some sample lines you can try:

- **Madam sees madam** â€” palindrome by **letters and words**  
- **Red roses fade fade roses red** â€” palindrome by **words only**  
- **Was it a car or a cat I saw** â€” palindrome by **letters only**  
- **I rap when I want, no cap** â€” *not* a palindrome  

You can even write your own bars in **Hinglish** and test them.  
Just a fun little project for small artists, writers, and anyone who loves playing with words and flows.

**Check your vocab. Flip your lines.**  
Your next hook might just rhyme both ways.
